Description: interactive parallel visualization and graphical analysis tool
 VisIt is a free interactive parallel visualization and graphical
 analysis tool for viewing scientific data.  Users can quickly generate
 visualizations from their data, animate them through time, manipulate
 them, and save the resulting images for presentations.  VisIt contains
 a rich set of visualization features so that you can view your data in
 a variety of ways.  It can be used to visualize scalar and vector
 fields defined on two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) structured and
 unstructured meshes.
 .
 VisIt was designed to handle very large data set sizes in the terascale
 range and yet can also handle small data sets in the kilobyte range.
